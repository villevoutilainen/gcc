/* An in-tree, built-in counterpart of the experimental testsuite
   plugin gcc/testsuite/g++.dg/plugin/gimple_object_address_plugin.cc,
   gated by two new, independent flags (-fcontract-conveyor-proofs-
   gimple/-fcontract-symbolic-proofs-gimple) mirroring contracts.cc's
   own -fcontract-conveyor-proofs/-fcontract-symbolic-proofs, run as a
   real gimple_opt_pass right after SSA is built ("ssa"), instead of
   contracts.cc's own AST-walk (hooked at PLUGIN_PRE_GENERICIZE).

   Registered from init_contracts (contracts.cc) via a direct
   register_pass call, the same way a plugin's own
   PLUGIN_PASS_MANAGER_SETUP callback would -- NOT listed in
   passes.def, since passes.def/pass-instances.def are shared by every
   language driver via libbackend.a, and make_pass_contracts_gimple
   only exists in the C++ front end's own object file; referencing it
   from passes.def leaves cc1/lto1 with an unresolved symbol at link
   time.

   Full design rationale, the validated plugin prototype this ports
   from, and the one-way-trust model this replicates:
   ~/gimple-contract-analysis.md (outside this repo).

   Design (same as the plugin prototype): never analyzes a contract's
   own outlined GIMPLE machinery (F.pre/F.post/the predicate-core
   function/the thunk) -- reads a function's *declared* precondition/
   postcondition text directly off its own FUNCTION_DECL
   (get_fn_contract_specifiers/CONTRACT_CONDITION), and does the "is
   this argument provably true, right here" part with ordinary GIMPLE/
   SSA reasoning. Flavor (conveyor-active vs symbolic-active) is read
   via the *cached* accessors (oa_contract_conveyor_active_cached_p/
   oa_contract_symbolic_active_cached_p) -- calling the real, semantic-
   analysis-backed oa_contract_conveyor_active_p/oa_contract_symbolic_
   active_p directly from here was tried first and found, by direct
   testing, to silently answer incorrectly this late; see the cache's
   own comment in contracts.cc for the full account.

   One-way trust, replicated from the AST-walk's own shared substrate
   (see oa_predicate_fact's own comment in contracts.cc): a fact
   established by a conveyor-active contract is trustworthy enough for
   a symbolic-flavored obligation to rely on; a fact established by a
   symbolic-active contract must never satisfy a conveyor-flavored
   obligation. CONVEYOR_ESTABLISHED, carried alongside every fact this
   file tracks, is exactly that provenance tag.

   Scope for this first increment: is_object_address and nonzero-ness
   only (self-trust, call-site consult, and item 6's postcondition-
   return-value guarantee) -- general ranges and the two persistent-
   object fact shapes (named predicates, ptr->field ranges) are not
   yet ported from the validated plugin prototype. IILE recursion
   remains permanently out of scope, per the same instruction that
   applied to the plugin prototype.  */
